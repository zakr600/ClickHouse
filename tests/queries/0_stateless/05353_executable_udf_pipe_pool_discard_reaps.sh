# A pooled worker of the pipe transport that a borrow finds unfit - here, one that wrote a row to its
# stdout once it was back in the pool - is discarded before anything is built on it. Nobody is
# interested in how it exits, so it is not given `command_termination_timeout` (set far beyond the
# time limit of the test, so that waiting it out would be a hang): it is killed and reaped at once, and
# does not stay behind as a zombie - even though it does not exit on stdin EOF.
