# A growth of the shared-memory region settles the query's whole charge for the region against its
# footprint, not only the part the growth added. The command here commits pages past the end of the
# region's file while it holds the region (`fallocate` with `FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE`), then asks for a
# larger region. Those pages are in the footprint the growth re-reads, and the growth is charged on
# top of them: under a memory limit that the region as created fits and the region with those pages
# does not, the growth is refused.

# often - hits the limit first; the query fails with that thread's `MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` instead of
# the UDF's `UDF_EXECUTION_FAILED` around it. Either is the growth being refused - which the counters
# say for certain: the command was called, and the region did not grow.
