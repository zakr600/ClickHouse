# A pooled shared-memory UDF (see `shm_protocol.py`) whose process tree outlives its own discarding
# unless the server ends it. At startup it forks a descendant that keeps the inherited descriptor of
# the region (and nothing else), ignores `SIGTERM` and sleeps. It answers its request with a stray
# byte after the response frame - in the same write, so the server's hand-back probe is sure to see
# it and discard the worker - and when its stdin reaches EOF it does not exit either: it ignores
# `SIGTERM` and sleeps. Both write their pids, as `worker` and `descendant`, into the directory
# named by the argument. Either of them alive after the server dropped the region could still write
# into it.
