# after the input - and does to its region's file what the flags say. A command holds a writable
# descriptor to its region, and the seals stop it only from shrinking the file: it can extend the file,
# commit pages past its end (`fallocate` with `FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE`), or free pages inside it
# (`FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE`). What the server does about it is the test's business.

# Extends the file before answering, on every request: to twice its size, or - with `page` - to one
# page. The pages it adds are what the server has to notice at the next hand-over. A file shorter than
# a page holds one either way; with `page` the point is whether the cap is on the pages or on the
# length.
parser.add_argument("--extend", choices=["double", "page"])
# Commits pages past the end of the file before any response goes out - the answer, or a request for a
# larger region - so that the pages are there by the time the server acts on it: twice the file's
# length of them, right past its end. The file's length does not change, so a server that measured its
# regions by their length alone would never see those pages.
#
# With values, the pages go somewhere else: three of them (or as many as fit in the number of bytes
# the second value gives - bytes, so that a configuration means the same on every page size) at the
# absolute offset the first value gives, far past the end of the file, the same ones on every call. A
# growth of the file that stops short of them commits its own pages on top of them, not instead of
# them. A third value stretches the file to that length first, without committing a page
# (`ftruncate`): length without pages, next to pages without length.

# After answering and before the response goes out, so that the test finds the hole there the moment
# the query returns: frees every page past the answer with `FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE | FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE`.
# The file stays exactly as long. Not the answer itself - the server is about to read it, and a command
# that wiped its own answer would just fail its own query.
parser.add_argument("--punch-hole", action="store_true")
# Like `--punch-hole`, and then commits as many pages past the end of the file with
# `FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE`: the file keeps its length and its number of committed pages, so a server that
# measures the region by those two sees nothing - until something writes into the holes and the kernel
# allocates them again.
parser.add_argument("--hide-holes", action="store_true")
# Answers every row with the size of the region's file, writes the answer at the very end of that file,
# and, once, extends the file to the given size after answering - so that this request reports the
# size it was given. The next answer then lies past what the server mapped when it created the region:
# a server that brought its mapping up to the file reads it, one that kept working on the part it had
# mapped rejects the offset.
parser.add_argument("--report-size", type=int, metavar="EXTEND_TO")
# Reports, for every input row, whether the probed stretch of the region still holds anything: `clean`
# if the 4 KiB right after the input (or at `--peek-at`) are all zero, `dirty` otherwise. A previous
# request's larger input or output leaves its bytes there unless the server scrubbed them; this is how
# the test sees whether it did. Then overwrites that stretch, so that the next request finds it dirty
# unless scrubbed again.
