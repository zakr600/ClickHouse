# - no-msan: Memory Sanitizer cannot work with vfork, which starts the command
# - no-darwin: shared-memory regions for executable UDFs are supported only on Linux

# A shared-memory command that exits as it should, on EOF, but leaves two descendants holding the
# inherited descriptor of the region: one in the command's process group, one that left it
# (`setsid`). The command is reaped only after its group is sent `SIGKILL`, so the first one does
# not outlive it - for `executable`, where the command exits at the end of the query, and for
# `executable_pool`, where it exits when the pool is torn down. The second one is out of reach, but
# the server frees the pages of the region's file as it drops the region, so the file that
# descendant still holds has no blocks left.
