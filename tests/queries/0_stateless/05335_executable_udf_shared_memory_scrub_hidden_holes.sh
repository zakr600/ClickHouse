# The scrub between borrowers writes every page of a pooled region, and a page the command freed
# inside the file is allocated again by that write. The command here hides such holes from the
# footprint: it frees every page past its answer and commits as many pages past the end of the
# file, so the file keeps its length and its number of committed pages and the borrow's checks see
# a region within the cap. The scrub for another user refills the holes and takes the region to
# almost twice the cap: that borrow fails, with the worker and its region, instead of carrying on
# with pages nobody was charged for. The next borrow starts a fresh worker.
#
# The pool lives as long as the process does, so both users come to the same one: one
# `clickhouse-local` listens on HTTP and sends itself the other user's queries, as in 05333. `url`
# does not retry (`shm_as_user`): a retry would land on the fresh worker and hide the failed borrow.
