/** Lets you run the command,
  *  read it stdout and stderr; write to stdin;
  *  wait for completion.
  *
  * The implementation is similar to the popen function from POSIX (see libc source code).
  *
  * The most important difference: uses vfork instead of fork.
  * This is done because fork does not work (with a memory shortage error),
  *  with some overcommit settings, if the address space of the process is more than half the amount of available memory.
  * Also, changing memory maps - a fairly resource-intensive operation.
  *
  * The second difference - allows to work simultaneously with stdin, and with stdout, and with stderr of running process,
  *  and also to obtain the return code and completion status.
